\abstract{A variety of disciplines use risk assessment instruments to help humans
make data-driven decisions. Northpointe, a software company, created a
risk assessment instrument known as the Correctional Offender Management
Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS). COMPAS uses various
behavioral and psychological metrics related to recidivism to assist
justice systems in assessing a defendant's potential recidivism risk.
ProPublica published an article which concludes that the biases in the
criminal justice system are reflected in the COMPAS software. Using a
human rights framework adopted from the organization Women at the Table,
we use various debiasing algorithms to analyze both sides of the
argument between Northpointe and ProPublica and determine the level and
extent of racial bias in the COMPAS algorithm.}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Women @ the Table, the sponsor organization for this project, is ``a
growing, global gender equality \& democracy CSO based in Geneva,
Switzerland focused on advancing feminist systems change by using the
prism of technology, innovation \& AI exercising leverage points in
technology, the economy, sustainability \& democratic governance''
\citep{noauthor_womenthetable_nodate}. We have been asked to collaborate
on their AI \& Equality \citep{noauthor_ai_nodate} initiative, tasked
with debiasing the COMPAS algorithm
\citep{noauthor_aif360datasetscompasdataset_2018} and producing a
corresponding data story that will be added to their library.

The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions
(COMPAS) algorithm was created by the private for-profit company
Northpointe, also known by its parent company Equivant
\citep{equivant_faq_nodate}, to predict defendants' risk of recidivism.
It generates a score that classifies defendants' risk of recidivism as
either low, medium, or high \citep{angwin2016machine}. Jurisdictions
across the United States use the COMPAS risk assessment instrument. In
2016, ProPublica published a piece that analyzed the methods and
algorithms used by Northpointe to uncover racial biases in defendants'
scores \citep{angwin2016machine}. Their analysis looks at the
distribution of decile COMPAS scores among Black and white defendants.
ProPublica concludes, after using a statistical parity metric on false
positives or false negatives, that the algorithm is racially biased
\citep{larson2016we}. Northpointe denies the allegations of racial bias,
conducting their own analyses based on different statistical parity
metrics \citep{equivant_response_2018}. Since then, the two parties have
had several exchanges, maintaining their original arguments. Currently,
the two parties' disagreement focuses on pretrial Risk Assessment
Instruments (RAIs). ProPublica maintains that there are biases in the
outcome values, protected attributes, and covariates during
Northpointe's data processing phase. ProPublica accounts for these
biases in their analyses, and Northepointe's response, highlights how
ProPublica did not account for base rates of recidivism in their
analysis, which are important to understand initial percentages without
the presence of other information.

Our project builds on Women at the Table's various debiasing algorithms
to conduct our own analyses on the COMPAS dataset. Based on this
analysis, we employ a human rights framework to contribute to the
ongoing ProPublica and Northpointe debate and investigate whether or to
what extent there is racial bias in the COMPAS algorithm. With a solid
understanding of the two sides, we aim to pinpoint the shortcomings of
both arguments and correct them in our analyses. We will use various
machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, cross
validation, and lasso and ridge techniques to choose models. We will
summarize our results using the JupyterNotebook framework from Women at
the Table, to be used by members of the organization to teach in a
workshop setting. We hope that our findings will highlight the
importance of checking statistical analyses using varied methods and
contribute to the ongoing discussion of the effects of machine biases in
the justice system.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

The data we are using for this project is the COMPAS General Recidivism
Risk Scores dataset from ProPublica used in their original analysis
\citep{larson_propublicacompas-analysiscompas-scores-two-yearscsv_2022}.
The COMPAS dataset we are using is from AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit
\citep{noauthor_trusted-ai_360} which does the same initial
preprocessing as ProPublica. The raw data has 6,167 rows and each row
represents an arrest charge for a defendant. ProPublica's COMPAS data
includes the defendant's age, race, sex, what they were charged with,
and whether or not the defendant ultimately recidivated within a
two-year period after their arrest. For the purposes of our project,
which endeavors to evaluate the differing effects of the COMPAS
algorithm on white defendants and Black defendants, we have filtered the
data to only include individuals whose race is listed as Caucasian or
African-American. Our data therefore has 5,723 rows (Figure
\ref{fig:table snip}), with the below distributions of race (Figure
\ref{fig:race plot}), age (Figure \ref{fig:age plot}), and two year
recidivism rate (Figures \ref{fig:recid plot} \&
\ref{fig:recid race plot}).
